Welcome to Opytimark's documentation!
======================================

Did you ever need a set of pre-defined functions in order to test your optimization algorithm? Are you tired of implementing and validating by hand every function? If yes, Opytimark is the real deal! This package provides straightforward implementation of benchmarking functions for optimization tasks.

Use Opytimark if you need a library or wish to:

* Create your benchmarking function.
* Design or use pre-loaded benchmarking functions.
* Because it is overwhelming to evaluate things.

Opytimark is compatible with: **Python 3.6+**.
